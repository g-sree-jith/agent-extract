### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes
4. Make sure your code lints
5. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agent-extract.git
cd agent-extract

# Install with development dependencies
uv sync --all-extras
# or
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest

# Run linting
ruff check src/ tests/
black src/ tests/ --check

# Format code
black src/ tests/
```

## Coding Style

* Follow PEP 8 guidelines
* Use type hints wherever possible
* Write descriptive docstrings for all public functions/classes
* Maximum line length: 100 characters
* Use `black` for code formatting
* Use `ruff` for linting

## Testing

* Write unit tests for all new features
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Aim for >80% code coverage
* Test on multiple document types when relevant

## Commit Messages

* Use clear and meaningful commit messages
* Start with a verb in present tense (Add, Fix, Update, Remove)
* Keep the first line under 72 characters
* Add detailed description if needed

Examples:
```
Add support for Excel file extraction

## Adding New Features

### Adding a New Document Reader

1. Create a new file in `src/agent_extract/readers/`
2. Inherit from `BaseReader`
3. Implement the `read()` method
4. Add file extensions to `supported_extensions`
5. Register in `ReaderFactory`
6. Write tests

Example:
```python
from agent_extract.readers.base import BaseReader
from agent_extract.core.types import ExtractionResult

class NewFormatReader(BaseReader):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.supported_extensions = {".ext"}
    
    def read(self, file_path: Path) -> ExtractionResult:
        # Implementation
        pass
```

### Adding a New Output Format

1. Create a new file in `src/agent_extract/outputs/`
2. Implement `format()` and `format_to_file()` methods
3. Add tests
4. Update CLI to support new format

## Documentation

* Update README.md for user-facing changes
* Update USAGE_GUIDE.md for new features
* Add docstrings to all new code
* Update PROJECT_PLAN.md if adding new phases/features
