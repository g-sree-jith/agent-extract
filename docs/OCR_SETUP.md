# OCR Setup & Configuration

## ✅ **Quick Answer: Everything is Already Working!**

You **don't need to install anything extra**. The system is configured and working.

---

## 🔍 **Current Setup**

### **OCR Engines Installed:**

| Engine | Version | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Tesseract** | Latest | ✅ Working (Default) |
| **PaddleOCR** | 3.3.0 | ⚠️ Installed but incompatible |

### **What's Being Used:**

**Tesseract** is now the default OCR engine because:
- ✅ Works perfectly with LangChain 1.0.0
- ✅ No compatibility issues
- ✅ Good accuracy
- ✅ Fast and reliable
- ✅ Already installed via pytesseract

---

## ⚠️ **Why PaddleOCR Shows Warning**

### The Technical Issue:

```
PaddleOCR 3.3.0 → requires → langchain.docstore.document
LangChain 1.0.0 → moved to → langchain_core.documents
                  ↓
            Incompatibility!
```

### What Happens:

1. System tries PaddleOCR
2. Import fails (langchain module structure changed)
3. **Automatically falls back to Tesseract** ✅
4. Extraction continues perfectly!

**Result**: You get the warning, but extraction works fine.

---

## 🔧 **Configuration (No Action Needed)**

### Current Default:
```python
# src/agent_extract/core/config.py
ocr_engine = "tesseract"  # Default (no warnings!)
ocr_language = "eng"      # English for Tesseract
```

### If You Want PaddleOCR (Optional):

**Fix the compatibility:**
```bash
# Install langchain-community (has old modules)
uv pip install langchain-community
```

**Then switch back:**
```env
# .env file
OCR_ENGINE=paddle
OCR_LANGUAGE=en
```

## 📊 **OCR Comparison**

| Feature | Tesseract | PaddleOCR |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Installation** | ✅ Working | ⚠️ Needs langchain-community |
| **Accuracy (English)** | 85-90% | 90-95% |
| **Speed** | Fast | Fast |
| **Languages** | 100+ | 80+ |
| **Compatibility** | ✅ No issues | ⚠️ LangChain conflict |
| **File Size** | Small | Large (~200MB models) |

### **Recommendation:**

**Stick with Tesseract** for now:
- ✅ Already working
- ✅ No warnings
- ✅ Good enough for most documents
- ✅ No extra installation

**Use PaddleOCR** if you need:
- Maximum accuracy for complex documents
- Better handling of rotated text
- Multi-language Asian language support

## 🎯 **Your Current Workflow**

### **What's Actually Running:**

```
Image (PNG) 
  ↓
Tesseract OCR → Extracts text (1035 chars) ✓
  ↓
AI Agents (qwen3 + gemma3) → Intelligent extraction ✓
  ↓
Structured JSON output ✓
```

**Everything works perfectly!** The warning is just informational.

## 🚀 **Testing Your PNG Image**

### **Results from test-img.png:**

```
✓ OCR: Tesseract extracted 1035 characters
✓ AI: Planner created strategy
✓ AI: Supervisor routing to agents
✓ AI: Vision Agent (gemma3) analyzing image
✓ AI: Schema detected document type: "form"
✓ AI: Quality validation: 85% confidence
```

## 💡 **If You Want to Use PaddleOCR Later:**

### **Step 1: Fix Compatibility**
```bash
uv pip install langchain-community
```

### **Step 2: Test It**
```bash
uv run python -c "from paddleocr import PaddleOCR; print('PaddleOCR works!')"
```

### **Step 3: Switch Config**
```env
# .env
OCR_ENGINE=paddle
OCR_LANGUAGE=en
```

## ✅ **Bottom Line**

### **Do you need to install anything?**
**NO!** ❌

### **Is OCR working?**
**YES!** ✅ (Tesseract)

### **Is AI extraction working?**
**YES!** ✅ (qwen3 + gemma3)

### **Should you do anything?**
**NO!** Everything is configured and working! 🎉

---

**The "Primary OCR engine failed" message is just a warning that PaddleOCR couldn't initialize. The system immediately switches to Tesseract and continues perfectly!**

**No action needed on your part** ✅
